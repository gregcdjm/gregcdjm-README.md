# Hi there

-   Hello! I'm Grégoire Coudrin and currently a student in @Holberton School PARIS . I'd be finishing my studies in 15 months and I'm looking for an internship Blockchain | Machine Learning| I’m very interested in game development.

-   During my first year at Holberton, I worked mainly in C language, Python and bash scripting. Thus I’m comfortable with algorithm with C.

-   I recreated the printf function and Linux Shell with 2 different groups. Thanks to the school learning approach we learned to work collaboratively, in person and remotely
