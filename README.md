# Hi there

-   Hello! I'm Grégoire Coudrin and currently looking for alternation . I'm looking for an internship Blockchain | Machine Learning| Devops | I’m very interested in game development and AI technology.

-   During my first year at Holberton and at Diderot University (Physic Licence), I worked mainly in C language, Python(+matrix and numpy), SQL, HTML5, JS and bash scripting. Thus I’m comfortable with algorithm with #C and Python.

-   I recreated the printf function and Linux Shell with 2 different groups on #C, and a RPG game in Python with TKINTER. Thanks to the school learning approach we learned to work collaboratively, in person and remotely

-   If you reread my codes you need (usually) to look at the rigth main (X-main.c/py <---> X-file_name.c/py) and the right file and compile both to check them. Others file without X-main.c/py are just answer for the automatic AI checking of Holberton-School.

## If you want to reach out to me, you can message/call me on:
